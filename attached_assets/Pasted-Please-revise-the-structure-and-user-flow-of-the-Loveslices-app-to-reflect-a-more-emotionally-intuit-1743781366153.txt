Please revise the structure and user flow of the Loveslices app to reflect a more emotionally intuitive experience focused on deepening connection between users. This is a relationship app rooted in reflection, emotional safety, and shared truth.

Here’s how the revised system should work:

---

🔹 1. **Questions (Core Feature)**  
- Questions are delivered one at a time.  
- Each user answers privately.  
- Once both have answered, their responses form a **Loveslice**—a shared emotional moment.  
- That Loveslice is added to the **Journal** and **Garden** (the visual metaphor for relationship growth).  
- Language: “Reflect Now” → “Answer & Plant” → “View Loveslice”

---

🔹 2. **Loveslices**  
- A Loveslice is created whenever both users respond to the same question.  
- It includes both entries, the date, and associated theme (e.g. Trust, Intimacy).  
- Each Loveslice adds a new element to the garden visualization.  
- Garden growth is tied to frequency, diversity of themes, and optional streaks—always encouraging, never shame-based.

---

🔹 3. **Conversations (Optional Follow-up)**  
- After a Loveslice is formed, users can choose:  
  > “Would you like to talk about this together?”  
- This starts an in-app **Conversation** thread.  
- These conversations can now become **Spoken Loveslices**, rewarding couples for showing up and communicating.

➡️ Conversation → Spoken Loveslice logic:
- When the conversation ends, the app gently asks:
  > “Was this a meaningful moment for you both?”
- Let users select an outcome (optional, no pressure):
  - ✅ We connected
  - 🌱 We tried and listened
  - 🌧️ It was hard but honest
- Log the conversation duration and chosen outcome.
- This becomes a **Spoken Loveslice**, which also adds to Garden growth and appears in the Journal.

---

🔹 4. **Conversation Starters (Lightweight Tools)**  
- These are casual prompts to spark spontaneous in-person or in-app dialogue.  
- No formal response needed.  
- Not logged as Loveslices unless the user explicitly saves or “Marks as Meaningful.”

Label clearly:  
> “Spark real-time connection—no pressure to record.”

Users can filter by theme: Trust, Intimacy, Conflict, Dreams, Play, Money.  
Allow users to create their own as well.

---

🔹 5. **Journal**  
- A timeline of all past Loveslices—written and spoken.  
- Includes both users’ answers and optional Conversation transcripts if enabled.  
- Private and searchable by theme or keyword.

---

🔹 6. **Garden**  
- The emotional garden that grows with each Loveslice.  
- Modular, calm, painterly visual.  
- Elements appear based on engagement, not gamified scores:
  - Flowers for intimacy
  - Trees for trust
  - Paths for effort
  - Reflections for conflict  
- Garden Health is visible but only speaks in kind, encouraging language.

Please update the UI and flow to reflect this emotionally rich and modular design. Use warm, inclusive language throughout. Thank you!
