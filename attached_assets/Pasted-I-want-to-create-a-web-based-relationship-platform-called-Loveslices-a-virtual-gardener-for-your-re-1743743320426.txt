I want to create a web-based relationship platform called Loveslices—a “virtual gardener for your relationship.”

The goal is to help individuals or couples deepen connection through emotionally intelligent conversation prompts and shared reflections.

Core functionality:
	•	Users sign up either as individuals or as part of a couple (in a linked account).
	•	Sign-up/login should support Google, Facebook, and Apple Auth, in addition to email/password.
	•	After signing in, users receive a thoughtful question (daily or weekly) related to intimacy, trust, values, or emotional growth.
	•	Each partner answers privately. Responses are only revealed if both have answered the same question.
	•	When this happens, it creates a Loveslice: a shared moment of authentic connection, logged in a private journal.

The app should include:
	•	Secure authentication with multiple sign-in options (Google, Facebook, Apple, email/password)
	•	Ability to join as an individual or invite/link a partner account via a secure code or email invite
	•	A question delivery system with a curated question database (tagged by theme: Trust, Intimacy, Conflict, Growth, Sex, Dreams, Money, etc.)
	•	“Answer-to-unlock” logic for questions
	•	A dashboard or “Garden” view that shows past Loveslices
	•	Optional solo mode (for singles or self-reflection users)

Future feature ideas (stretch goals):
	•	Guided journeys called “Seasons of Growth” (e.g., Trust, Reconnection, Desire, Play)
	•	An AI-based “Gardener” that notices patterns and suggests questions based on emotional themes
	•	Notifications/reminders with a gentle tone (e.g., “A new slice is ready to blossom”)

Tech:
Please use React for the frontend, and Firebase or PostgreSQL for the backend, depending on best fit. You may use Firebase Auth for OAuth login if easier.

Future Planning: 
Loveslices can evolve to offer more features around intimacy, conectedness, couples workshops, tutorials, games and content to help couples grow.

Generate initial routes, data models, and components for:
	•	Auth
	•	Question flow
	•	Matching/answer logic
	•	Love Slice dashboard
	•	Invite system for couples

Also include a starter database with example questions. Here are some to include:

🌿 Example Love Slices Questions:

Theme: Trust
	•	“What helps you feel safe enough to be fully yourself with me?”
	•	“What’s one thing you’ve never told me, not because it’s bad—but because it felt too vulnerable?”

Theme: Intimacy
	•	“What do you miss most when we’re emotionally distant?”
	•	“How do you like to be touched when you’re feeling sad?”

Theme: Conflict
	•	“When I withdraw during conflict, what do you imagine I’m feeling?”
	•	“What’s something you wish I understood better when we argue?”

Theme: Dreams
	•	“If we could build a life anywhere, what would it look like?”
	•	“What do you still hope to experience together that we haven’t yet?”

Theme: Play
	•	“What’s one silly or spontaneous thing we could do this month?”
	•	“When do you feel most light-hearted around me?”

Build this as a gentle, poetic space. Let the UI be minimal and nurturing—more like a journal than an app.
Let it feel like tending a garden of connection. 🌸
