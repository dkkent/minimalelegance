# Skip Question Feature Implementation

## Overview
We've implemented the "Skip for Now" feature in the Loveslices application, allowing users to skip questions they don't want to answer immediately while still maintaining a transparent communication flow with their partner.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Multi-Step Dialog Flow
- **First Screen**: Confirmation dialog asking if the user wants to skip, with clear explanation
- **Second Screen**: Dropdown select with predefined skip reasons

### 2. Skip Reasons Dropdown Options
We've implemented the following skip reason options:
- "I'm not ready to talk about this yet"
- "I need more time to reflect"
- "This feels too sensitive right now"
- "Let's come back to this another day"
- "I don't think we need to discuss this"

### 3. UI/UX Improvements
- Center-aligned text for better readability
- Improved button labels with clear actions
- Removed colored icons from buttons for a cleaner look
- Added gentle animations for transitions between screens
- Implemented loading animation when fetching a new question

### 4. Schema Updates
- Added `skipped` boolean field to track skipped questions
- Added `skipReason` field to store the selected reason
- Added `skippedAt` timestamp to track when questions were skipped

### 5. Security Enhancement
- Implemented data masking for sensitive information like emails
  - Example: "j*********@gmail.com" instead of the full email
